# Optimization_DOPS

TODO:
 1. ~~Modify the projected gradient descent to correct implementation of soft margin SVM.~~
 2. ~~Test one-to-one cover vs. one-to-many (S_w vs. C(S_w))~~
 3. ~~Explore how to incorporate multi-level coverage~~
 4. Think of other submodular applications of ICU dataset
 5. Understand the principles of DOPS
 6. explore other promising dataset
 7. ~~try "quantile loss"~~
